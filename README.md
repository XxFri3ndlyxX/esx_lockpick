# esx_lockpick
Simple lockpick kit script for FiveM ESX servers

What does it do?
It is a lockpick system that locks all npc car. You need a lockpick to unlock the doors.
You can set the % of success and set the cops to be alerted if lockpick attempt is failed and with %
You can also set the alarm to be triggered fox x ammount of time.
You can also trigger a jammed handbrake when successfully unlocked the vehicle.
You can now whitelist some job to always have vehicle unlocked.
You can now blacklist some vehicle.
There is a chance the vehicle will be unlocked.

My attempt on making hotwiring longer failed so for the time being the jammed handbrake will do the job.
